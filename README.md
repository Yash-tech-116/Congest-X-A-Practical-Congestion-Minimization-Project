# Congest-X-A-Practical-Congestion-Minimization-Project
CongestX is a mini physical design project focused on routing congestion analysis and optimization using Synopsys ICC2. The design undergoes a complete placement → congestion mapping → blockage insertion → ECO-placement → final congestion validation flow
